**Python Machine Learning Mini-Course**
=======================================

Python is one of the fastest-growing platforms for applied machine
learning.
In this mini-course, you will discover how you can get started, build
accurate models and confidently complete predictive modeling machine
learning projects using Python in 14 days.

Let’s get started.

#### Pre-reqs:
- Google Chrome (Recommended)

#### Lab Environment
Notebooks are ready to run. All packages have been installed. There is no requirement for any setup.

**Note:** 

- Elev8ed Notebooks (powered by Jupyter) will be accessible at the port given to you by your instructor. Password for jupyterLab : `1234`
- To copy and paste: use **Control-C** and to paste inside of a terminal, use **Control-V**
- Incase you get an error running any notebook, try running it again. 

All Notebooks are present in `work/python-minicourses` folder.

You can access jupyter lab at `<host-ip>:<port>/lab/workspaces/lab6_Python_Machine_Learning`

**Who Is This Mini-Course For?** 
--------------------------------

Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place.

The list below provides some general guidelines as to who this course
was designed for.

Don’t panic if you don’t match these points exactly, you might just need
to brush up in one area or another to keep up.

-   **Developers that know how to write a little code**. This means that
    it is not a big deal for you to pick up a new programming language
    like Python once you know the basic syntax. It does not mean you’re
    a wizard coder, just that you can follow a basic C-like language
    with little effort.

-   **Developers that know a little machine learning**. This means you
    know the basics of machine learning like cross-validation, some
    algorithms and the [bias-variance
    trade-off](http://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-to-the-bias-variance-trade-off-in-machine-learning/).
    It does not mean that you are a machine learning Ph.D., just that
    you know the landmarks or know where to look them up.

This mini-course is neither a textbook on Python or a textbook on
machine learning.

It will take you from a developer that knows a little machine learning
to a developer who can get results using the Python ecosystem, the
rising platform for professional machine learning.

**Mini-Course Overview** 
------------------------

This mini-course is broken down into 14 lessons.

You could complete one lesson per day (recommended) or complete all of
the lessons in one day (hard core!). It really depends on the time you
have available and your level of enthusiasm.

Below are 14 lessons that will get you started and productive with
machine learning in Python:

-   **Lesson 1**: Download and Install Python and SciPy ecosystem.

-   **Lesson 2**: Get Around In Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.

-   **Lesson 3**: Load Data From CSV.

-   **Lesson 4**: Understand Data with Descriptive Statistics.

-   **Lesson 5**: Understand Data with Visualization.

-   **Lesson 6**: Prepare For Modeling by Pre-Processing Data.

-   **Lesson 7**: Algorithm Evaluation With Resampling Methods.

-   **Lesson 8**: Algorithm Evaluation Metrics.

-   **Lesson 9**: Spot-Check Algorithms.

-   **Lesson 10**: Model Comparison and Selection.

-   **Lesson 11**: Improve Accuracy with Algorithm Tuning.

-   **Lesson 12**: Improve Accuracy with Ensemble Predictions.

-   **Lesson 13**: Finalize And Save Your Model.

-   **Lesson 14**: Hello World End-to-End Project.

Each lesson could take you 60 seconds or up to 30 minutes. Take your
time and complete the lessons at your own pace. Ask questions and even
post results in the comments below.

The lessons expect you to go off and find out how to do things. I will
give you hints, but part of the point of each lesson is to force you to
learn where to go to look for help on and about the Python platform.

**Hang in there, don’t give up!**

**Lesson 1: Download and Install Python and SciPy** 
---------------------------------------------------

You cannot get started with machine learning in Python until you have
access to the platform.

Today’s lesson is easy, you must download and install the Python 3.6
platform on your computer.

Visit the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/) and download Python
for your operating system (Linux, OS X or Windows). Install Python on
your computer. You may need to use a platform specific package manager
such as macports on OS X or yum on RedHat Linux.

You also need to install the [SciPy platform](https://www.python.org/)
and the scikit-learn library. I recommend using the same approach that
you used to install Python.

You can install everything at once (much easier) [with
Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Recommended for
beginners.

Start Python for the first time by typing “python” at the command line.

Check the versions of everything you are going to need using the code
below:

```
# Python version
import sys
print('Python: {}'.format(sys.version))
# scipy
import scipy
print('scipy: {}'.format(scipy.__version__))
# numpy
import numpy
print('numpy: {}'.format(numpy.__version__))
# matplotlib
import matplotlib
print('matplotlib: {}'.format(matplotlib.__version__))
# pandas
import pandas
print('pandas: {}'.format(pandas.__version__))
# scikit-learn
import sklearn
print('sklearn: {}'.format(sklearn.__version__))
```


##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `1.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


**Lesson 2: Get Around In Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You need to be able to read and write basic Python scripts.

As a developer, you can pick-up new programming languages pretty
quickly. Python is case sensitive, uses hash (#) for comments and uses
whitespace to indicate code blocks (whitespace matters).

Today’s task is to practice the basic syntax of the Python programming
language and important SciPy data structures in the Python interactive
environment.

-   Practice assignment, working with lists and flow control in Python.

-   Practice working with NumPy arrays.

-   Practice creating simple plots in Matplotlib.

-   Practice working with Pandas Series and DataFrames.

For example, below is a simple example of creating a Pandas
**DataFrame**.

```
# dataframe
import numpy
import pandas
myarray = numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
rownames = ['a', 'b']
colnames = ['one', 'two', 'three']
mydataframe = pandas.DataFrame(myarray, index=rownames, columns=colnames)
print(mydataframe)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `2.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


**Lesson 3: Load Data From CSV** 
--------------------------------

Machine learning algorithms need data. You can load your own data from
CSV files but when you are getting started with machine learning in
Python you should practice on standard machine learning datasets.

Your task for today’s lesson is to get comfortable loading data into
Python and to find and load standard machine learning datasets.

There are many excellent standard machine learning datasets in CSV
format that you can download and practice with on the [UCI machine
learning
repository](http://machinelearningmastery.com/practice-machine-learning-with-small-in-memory-datasets-from-the-uci-machine-learning-repository/).

-   Practice loading CSV files into Python using the
    [CSV.reader()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) in the
    standard library.

-   Practice loading CSV files using NumPy and the
    [numpy.loadtxt()](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)
    function.

-   Practice loading CSV files using Pandas and the
    [pandas.read_csv()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)
    function.

To get you started, below is a snippet that will load the Pima Indians
onset of diabetes dataset using Pandas directly from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository.

```
# Load CSV using Pandas from URL
import pandas
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
data = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
print(data.shape)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `3.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Well done for making it this far! Hang in there.

**Any questions so far? Ask in the comments.**

**Lesson 4: Understand Data with Descriptive Statistics** 
---------------------------------------------------------

Once you have loaded your data into Python you need to be able to
understand it.

The better you can understand your data, the better and more accurate
the models that you can build. The first step to understanding your data
is to use descriptive statistics.

Today your lesson is to learn how to use descriptive statistics to
understand your data. I recommend using the helper functions provided on
the Pandas DataFrame.

-   Understand your data using the **head()** function to look at the
    first few rows.

-   Review the dimensions of your data with the **shape** property.

-   Look at the data types for each attribute with the **dtypes**
    property.

-   Review the distribution of your data with the **describe()**
    function.

-   Calculate pairwise correlation between your variables using the
    **corr()** function.

The below example loads the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset and
summarizes the distribution of each attribute.

```
# Statistical Summary
import pandas
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
data = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
description = data.describe()
print(description)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `4.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

**Try it out!**

**Lesson 5: Understand Data with Visualization** 
------------------------------------------------

Continuing on from yesterday’s lesson, you must spend time to better
understand your data.
A second way to improve your understanding of your data is by using data
visualization techniques (e.g. plotting).

Today, your lesson is to learn how to use plotting in Python to
understand attributes alone and their interactions. Again, I recommend
using the helper functions provided on the Pandas DataFrame.

-   Use the **hist()** function to create a histogram of each attribute.

-   Use the **plot(kind=’box’)** function to create box-and-whisker
    plots of each attribute.

-   Use the **pandas.scatter_matrix()** function to create pairwise
    scatterplots of all attributes.

For example, the snippet below will load the diabetes dataset and create
a scatterplot matrix of the dataset.

```
# Scatter Plot Matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas
from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
data = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
scatter_matrix(data)
plt.show()
```


##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `5.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

**Lesson 6: Prepare For Modeling by Pre-Processing Data** 
---------------------------------------------------------

Your raw data may not be setup to be in the best shape for modeling.

Sometimes you need to preprocess your data in order to best present the
inherent structure of the problem in your data to the modeling
algorithms. In today’s lesson, you will use the pre-processing
capabilities provided by the scikit-learn.

The scikit-learn library provides two standard idioms for transforming
data. Each transform is useful in different circumstances: Fit and
Multiple Transform and Combined Fit-And-Transform.

There are many techniques that you can use to prepare your data for
modeling. For example, try out some of the following

-   Standardize numerical data (e.g. mean of 0 and standard deviation of
    1) using the scale and center options.

-   Normalize numerical data (e.g. to a range of 0-1) using the range
    option.

-   Explore more advanced feature engineering such as Binarizing.

For example, the snippet below loads the Pima Indians onset of diabetes
dataset, calculates the parameters needed to standardize the data, then
creates a standardized copy of the input data.

```
# Standardize data (0 mean, 1 stdev)
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas
import numpy
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
# separate array into input and output components
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
rescaledX = scaler.transform(X)
# summarize transformed data
numpy.set_printoptions(precision=3)
print(rescaledX[0:5,:])
```


##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `6.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


**Lesson 7: Algorithm Evaluation With Resampling Methods** 
----------------------------------------------------------

The dataset used to train a machine learning algorithm is called a
training dataset. The dataset used to train an algorithm cannot be used
to give you reliable estimates of the accuracy of the model on new data.
This is a big problem because the whole idea of creating the model is to
make predictions on new data.

You can use statistical methods called resampling methods to split your
training dataset up into subsets, some are used to train the model and
others are held back and used to estimate the accuracy of the model on
unseen data.

Your goal with today’s lesson is to practice using the different
resampling methods available in scikit-learn, for example:

-   Split a dataset into training and test sets.

-   Estimate the accuracy of an algorithm using k-fold cross validation.

-   Estimate the accuracy of an algorithm using leave one out cross
    validation.

The snippet below uses scikit-learn to estimate the accuracy of the
Logistic Regression algorithm on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes
dataset using 10-fold cross validation.

```
# Evaluate using Cross Validation
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
results = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold)
print(results)
```


##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `7.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


What accuracy did you get?


**Did you realize that this is the halfway point? Well done!**

**Lesson 8: Algorithm Evaluation Metrics** 
------------------------------------------

There are many different metrics that you can use to evaluate the skill
of a machine learning algorithm on a dataset.

You can specify the metric used for your test harness in scikit-learn
via the **cross_validation.cross_val_score()** function and defaults
can be used for regression and classification problems. Your goal with
today’s lesson is to practice using the different algorithm performance
metrics available in the scikit-learn package.

-   Practice using the Accuracy and LogLoss metrics on a classification
    problem.

-   Practice generating a confusion matrix and a classification report.

-   Practice using RMSE and RSquared metrics on a regression problem.

The snippet below demonstrates calculating the LogLoss metric on the
Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset.

```
# Cross Validation Classification LogLoss
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
scoring = 'neg_log_loss'
results = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
print(results)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `8.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


What log loss did you get? Let me know in the comments.

**Lesson 9: Spot-Check Algorithms** 
-----------------------------------

You cannot possibly know which algorithm will perform best on your data
beforehand.

You have to discover it using a process of trial and error. I call this
spot-checking algorithms. The scikit-learn library provides an interface
to many machine learning algorithms and tools to compare the estimated
accuracy of those algorithms.

In this lesson, you must practice spot checking different machine
learning algorithms.

-   Spot check linear algorithms on a dataset (e.g. linear regression,
    logistic regression and linear discriminate analysis).

-   Spot check some non-linear algorithms on a dataset (e.g. KNN, SVM
    and CART).

-   Spot-check some sophisticated ensemble algorithms on a dataset (e.g.
    random forest and stochastic gradient boosting).

For example, the snippet below spot-checks the K-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm on the Boston House Price dataset.

```
# KNN Regression
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.data"
names = ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV']
dataframe = read_csv(url, delim_whitespace=True, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:13]
Y = array[:,13]
kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
model = KNeighborsRegressor()
scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error'
results = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
print(results.mean())
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `9.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


What mean squared error did you get? Let me know in the comments.

**Lesson 10: Model Comparison and Selection** 
---------------------------------------------

Now that you know how to spot check machine learning algorithms on your
dataset, you need to know how to compare the estimated performance of
different algorithms and select the best model.

In today’s lesson, you will practice comparing the accuracy of machine
learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.

-   Compare linear algorithms to each other on a dataset.

-   Compare nonlinear algorithms to each other on a dataset.

-   Compare different configurations of the same algorithm to each
    other.

-   Create plots of the results comparing algorithms.

The example below compares Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant
Analysis to each other on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset.

```
# Compare Algorithms
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
# load dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
# prepare models
models = []
models.append(('LR', LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')))
models.append(('LDA', LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()))
# evaluate each model in turn
results = []
names = []
scoring = 'accuracy'
for name, model in models:
	kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
	cv_results = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
	results.append(cv_results)
	names.append(name)
	msg = "%s: %f (%f)" % (name, cv_results.mean(), cv_results.std())
	print(msg)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `10.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


Which algorithm got better results? Can you do better? Let me know in
the comments.

**Lesson 11: Improve Accuracy with Algorithm Tuning** 
-----------------------------------------------------

Once you have found one or two algorithms that perform well on your
dataset, you may want to improve the performance of those models.

One way to increase the performance of an algorithm is to tune its
parameters to your specific dataset.

The scikit-learn library provides two ways to search for combinations of
parameters for a machine learning algorithm. Your goal in today’s lesson
is to practice each.

-   Tune the parameters of an algorithm using a grid search that you
    specify.

-   Tune the parameters of an algorithm using a random search.

The snippet below uses is an example of using a grid search for the
Ridge Regression algorithm on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes
dataset.

```
# Grid Search for Algorithm Tuning
from pandas import read_csv
import numpy
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
alphas = numpy.array([1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001,0])
param_grid = dict(alpha=alphas)
model = Ridge()
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3)
grid.fit(X, Y)
print(grid.best_score_)
print(grid.best_estimator_.alpha)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `11.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Which parameters achieved the best results? Can you do better? Let me
know in the comments.

**Lesson 12: Improve Accuracy with Ensemble Predictions** 
---------------------------------------------------------

Another way that you can improve the performance of your models is to
combine the predictions from multiple models.

Some models provide this capability built-in such as random forest for
bagging and stochastic gradient boosting for boosting. Another type of
ensembling called voting can be used to combine the predictions from
multiple different models together.

In today’s lesson, you will practice using ensemble methods.

-   Practice bagging ensembles with the random forest and extra trees
    algorithms.

-   Practice boosting ensembles with the gradient boosting machine and
    AdaBoost algorithms.

-   Practice voting ensembles using by combining the predictions from
    multiple models together.

The snippet below demonstrates how you can use the Random Forest
algorithm (a bagged ensemble of decision trees) on the Pima Indians
onset of diabetes dataset.

```
# Random Forest Classification
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
num_trees = 100
max_features = 3
kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=num_trees, max_features=max_features)
results = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold)
print(results.mean())
```


##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `12.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


Can you devise a better ensemble? Let me know in the comments.

**Lesson 13: Finalize And Save Your Model** 
-------------------------------------------

Once you have found a well-performing model on your machine learning
problem, you need to finalize it.
In today’s lesson, you will practice the tasks related to finalizing
your model.
Practice making predictions with your model on new data (data unseen
during training and testing).
Practice saving trained models to file and loading them up again.

For example, the snippet below shows how you can create a Logistic
Regression model, save it to file, then load it later and make
predictions on unseen data.

```
# Save Model Using Pickle
from pandas import read_csv
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import pickle
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
test_size = 0.33
seed = 7
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=test_size, random_state=seed)
# Fit the model on 33%
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
# save the model to disk
filename = 'finalized_model.sav'
pickle.dump(model, open(filename, 'wb'))
 
# some time later...
 
# load the model from disk
loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb'))
result = loaded_model.score(X_test, Y_test)
print(result)
```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `13.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.


**Lesson 14: Hello World End-to-End Project** 
---------------------------------------------

You now know how to complete each task of a predictive modeling machine
learning problem.

In today’s lesson, you need to practice putting the pieces together and
working through a standard machine learning dataset end-to-end.

Work through the [iris
dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) end-to-end (the
hello world of machine learning)

This includes the steps:

1.  Understanding your data using descriptive statistics and
    visualization.

2.  Preprocessing the data to best expose the structure of the problem.

3.  Spot-checking a number of algorithms using your own test harness.

4.  Improving results using algorithm parameter tuning.

5.  Improving results using ensemble methods.

6.  Finalize the model ready for future use.

Take it slowly and record your results along the way.

What model did you use? What results did you get? Let me know in the
comments.

**The End!** 
------------

Take a moment and look back at how far you have come.

-   You started off with an interest in machine learning and a strong
    desire to be able to practice and apply machine learning using
    Python.

-   You downloaded, installed and started Python, perhaps for the first
    time and started to get familiar with the syntax of the language.

-   Slowly and steadily over the course of a number of lessons you
    learned how the standard tasks of a predictive modeling machine
    learning project map onto the Python platform.

-   Building upon the recipes for common machine learning tasks you
    worked through your first machine learning problems end-to-end using
    Python.

-   Using a standard template, the recipes and experience you have
    gathered you are now capable of working through new and different
    predictive modeling machine learning problems on your own.
