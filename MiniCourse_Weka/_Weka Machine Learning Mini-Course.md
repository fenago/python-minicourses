# Weka Machine Learning Mini-Course

***Become A Machine Learning Practitioner in 14-Days*** 

Machine learning is a fascinating study, but how do you actually use it
on your own problems?

You may be confused as to how best prepare your data for machine
learning, which algorithms to use or how to choose one model over
another.

In this lab, you will discover a 14-part crash course into applied
machine learning using the Weka platform without a single mathematical
equation or line of programming code.

After completing this mini course:

-   You will know how to work through a dataset end-to-end and deliver a
    set of predictions or a high-performance model.

-   You will know your way around the Weka machine learning workbench
    including how to explore algorithms and design controlled
    experiments.

-   You will know how to create multiple views of your problem, evaluate
    multiple algorithms and use statistics to choose the best performing
    model for your own predictive modeling problems.

Discover how to prepare data, fit models, and evaluate their
predictions, all without writing a line of code [in my new
book](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-mastery-weka/),
with 18 step-by-step tutorials and 3 projects with Weka.

Let’s get started.


**Who Is This Mini-Course For?** 
--------------------------------

Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place. The
list below provides some general guidelines as to who this course was
designed for.
Don’t panic if you don’t match these points exactly, you might just need
to brush up in one area or another to keep up.

You are a developer that knows a little machine learning.
This means you know about some of the basics of machine learning like
cross validation, some algorithms and the bias-variance trade-off. It
does not mean that you are a machine learning PhD, just that you know
the landmarks or know where to look them up.

It will take you from a developer that knows a little machine learning
to a developer who can use the Weka platform to work through a dataset
from beginning to end and deliver a set of predictions or a high
performance model.

**Mini-Course Overview (what to expect)** 
-----------------------------------------

This mini-course is divided into 14 parts.
Each lesson was designed to take you about 30 minutes. You might finish
some much sooner and for others you may choose to go deeper and spend
more time.

You can complete each part as quickly or as slowly as you like. A
comfortable schedule may be to complete one lesson per day over a two
week period. Highly recommended.

The topics you will cover over the next 14 lessons are as follows:

-   **Lesson 01**: Download and Install Weka.

-   **Lesson 02**: Load Standard Machine Learning Datasets.

-   **Lesson 03**: Descriptive Stats and Visualization.

-   **Lesson 04**: Rescale Your Data.

This is going to be a lot of fun.
You’re going to have to do some work though, a little reading, a little
tinkering in Weka. You want to get started in applied machine learning
right?


**Lesson 01: Download and Install Weka** 
----------------------------------------

The first thing to do is install the Weka software on your workstation.
Weka is free open source software. It is written in Java and can run on
any platform that supports Java, including:

-   Windows.
-   Mac OS X.
-   Linux.

You can download Weka as standalone software or as a version bundled
with Java.
If you do not already have Java installed on your system, I recommend
downloading and installing a version bundled with Java.

1.  Your task for this lesson is to visit the [Weka download
    page](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html),
    download and install Weka on your workstation.

#### Docker Image

**Note:** You can also use weka docker image to run the lab. You will need docker environment for that.

`docker run -d --network host --privileged --name kali-desktop fenago/kali-weka`

`docker exec -it kali-desktop bash -c "mkdir -p /root/Desktop/weka && cp -r /usr/share/doc/weka/ /root/Desktop && cd /root/Desktop && wget https://netix.dl.sourceforge.net/project/weka/datasets/datasets-numeric/datasets-numeric.jar && unzip datasets-numeric.jar && cp /root/Desktop/numeric/housing.arff /root/Desktop/numeric/housing-numeric.arff && sed -i 's/@attribute CHAS { 0, 1}/@attribute CHAS real/g' /root/Desktop/numeric/housing-numeric.arff"`

After setup is complete. You can open the kali Linux Desktop Notebook at http://host-ip:6080/vnc_auto.html

#### Open Weka GUI
- Select `Use Default Config` option first time.
- Open Terminal and enter following command as shown in the image below:
    `weka > /dev/null 2>&1`
    ![](1.png)

**Note:**
- If you get any error while connecting to `kali desktop`, restart the container.
- All weka directories which contains datasets/.arff/.arff.gz files have been created already on desktop at following locations:
        * /root/Desktop/weka/examples
        * /root/Desktop/numeric
    ![](2.png)
- Select `File of type` option as **All files** when opening dataset to view all files.
    ![](3.png)



**Lesson 02: Load Standard Machine Learning Datasets** 
------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have Weka installed, you need to load data.
Weka is designed to load data in a native format called ARFF. It is a
modified CSV format that includes additional information about the types
of each attribute (column).

Your Weka installation includes a subdirectory with a number of standard
machine learning datasets in ARFF format ready for you to load.
Weka also supports loading data from raw CSV files as well as a database
and converts the data to ARFF as needed.

In this lesson you will load a standard dataset in the Weka Explorer.

1.  Start Weka (click on the bird icon), this will start the Weka GUI
    Chooser.

2.  Click the "Explorer" button, this will open the Weka Explorer
    interface.

3.  Click the "Open file…" button and navigate to the data/ directory in
    your Weka installation and load the diabetes.arff dataset.

Note, if you do not have a data/ directory in your Weka installation, or
you cannot find it, download the .zip version of Weka from the [Weka
download webpage](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html),
unzip it and access the data/ directory.

You have just loaded your first dataset in Weka.
Try loading some of the other datasets in the data/ directory.
Try downloading a raw CSV file from the [UCI Machine Learning
repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) and loading it in Weka.

**Lesson 03: Descriptive Stats and Visualization** 
--------------------------------------------------

Once you can load data in Weka, it is important to take a look at it.
Weka lets you review descriptive statistics calculated from your data.
It also provides visualization tools.

In this lesson you will use Weka to learn more about your data.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser.

2.  Open the Weka Explorer.

3.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

4.  Click on different attributes in the "Attributes" list and review
    the details in the "Selected attribute" pane.

5.  Click the "Visualize All" button to review all attribute
    distributions.

6.  Click the "Visualize" tab and review the scatter plot matrix for all
    attributes.

Get comfortable reviewing the details for different attributes in the
"Preprocess" tab and tuning the scatter plot matrix in the "Visualize"
tab.

**Lesson 04: Rescale Your Data** 
--------------------------------

Raw data is often not suitable for modeling.
Often you can improve the performance of your machine learning models by
rescaling attributes.

In this lesson you will learn how to use data filters in Weka to rescale
your data. You will normalize all of the attributes for a dataset,
rescaling them to the consistent range of 0-to-1.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Choose" button in the "Filter" pane and select
    unsupervised.attribute.Normalize.

4.  Click the "Apply" button.

Review the details for each attribute in the "Selected attribute" pane
and note the change to the scale.

Explore using other data filters such as the Standardize filter.

Explore configuring filters by clicking on the name of the loaded filter
and changing it’s parameters.

Test out saving modified datasets for later use by clicking the "Save…"
button on the "Preprocess" tab.

**Lesson 05: Perform Feature Selection on Your Data** 
-----------------------------------------------------

Not all of the attributes in your dataset may be relevant to the
attribute you want to predict.

You can use feature selection to identify those attributes that are most
relevant to your output variable.

In this lesson you will get familiar with using different feature
selection methods.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Select attributes" tab.

4.  Click the "Choose" button in the "Attribute Evaluator" pane and
    select the "CorrelationAttributeEval".

    1.  You will be presented with a dialog asking you to change to the
        "Ranker" search method, needed when using this feature selection
        method. Click the "Yes" button.

5.  Click the "Start" button to run the feature selection method.

Review the output in the "Attribute selection output" pane and note the
correlation scores for each attribute, the larger numbers indicating the
more relevant features.

Explore other feature selection methods such as the use of information
gain (entropy).

Explore selecting features to removal from your dataset in the
"Preprocess" tab and the "Remove" button.

**Lesson 06: Machine Learning Algorithms in Weka** 
--------------------------------------------------

A key benefit of the Weka workbench is the large number of machine
learning algorithms it provides.
You need to know your way around machine learning algorithms.
In this lesson you will take a closer look at machine learning
algorithms in Weka.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

4.  Click the "Choose" button and note the different groupings for
    algorithms.

5.  Click the name of the selected algorithm to configure it.

6.  Click the "More" button on the configuration window to learn more
    about the implementation.

7.  Click the "Capabilities" button on the configuration window to learn
    more about how it can be used.

8.  Note the "Open" and "Save" buttons on the window where different
    configurations can be saved and loaded.

9.  Hover on a configuration parameter and note the tooltip help.

10. Click the "Start" button to run an algorithm.

Browse the algorithms available. Note that some algorithms are
unavailable given whether your dataset is a classification (predict a
category) or regression (predict a real value) type problem.

Explore and learn more about the various algorithms available in Weka.

Get confidence choosing and configuring algorithms.

**Lesson 07: Estimate Model Performance** 
-----------------------------------------

Now that you know how to choose and configure different algorithms, you
need to know how to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.
In this lesson you are going to learn about the different ways to
evaluate the performance of an algorithm in Weka.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

The "Test options" pane lists the various different techniques that you
can use to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.

-   The gold standard is 10-fold "Cross Validation". This is selected by
    default. For a small dataset, the number of folds can be adjusted
    from 10 to 5 or even 3.

-   If your dataset is very large and you want to evaluate algorithms
    quickly, you can use the "Percentage split" option. By default, this
    option will train on 66% of your dataset and use the remaining 34%
    to evaluate the performance of your model.

-   Alternately, if you have a separate file containing a validation
    dataset, you can evaluate your model on that by selecting the
    "Supplied test set" option. Your model will be trained on the entire
    training dataset and evaluated on the separate dataset.

-   Finally, you can evaluate the performance of your model on the whole
    training dataset. This is useful if you are more interested in a
    descriptive than a predictive model.

Click the "Start" button to run a given algorithm with your chosen test
option.

Experiment with different Test options.

Further refine the test options in the configuration provided by
clicking the "More options…" button.

**Lesson 08: Baseline Performance On Your Data** 
------------------------------------------------

When you start evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms on your
dataset, you need a baseline for comparison.

A baseline result gives you a point of reference to know whether the
results for a given algorithm are good or bad, and by how much.

In this lesson you will learn about the ZeroR algorithm that you can use
as a baseline for classification and regression algorithms.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab. The ZeroR algorithm is chosen by default.

4.  Click the "Start" button.

This will run the ZeroR algorithm using 10-fold cross validation on your
dataset.

The ZeroR algorithm also called the Zero Rule is an algorithm that you
can use to calculate a baseline of performance for all algorithms on
your dataset. It is the "worst" result and any algorithm that shows a
better performance has some skill on your problem.

On a classification algorithm, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict
the most abundant category. If the dataset has an equal number of
classes, it will predict the first category value.

On the diabetes dataset, this results in a classification accuracy of
65%.
For regression problems, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict the
mean output value.
Experiment with the ZeroR algorithm on a range of different datasets. It
is the algorithm you should always run first before all others to
develop a baseline.

**Lesson 09: Tour of Classification Algorithms** 
------------------------------------------------

Weka provides a large number of classification algorithms.

In this lesson you will discover 5 top classification algorithms that
you can use on your classification problems.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

4.  Click the "Choose" button.

5 Top algorithms that you can use for classification include:

-   Logistic Regression (functions.Logistic).

-   Naive Bayes (bayes.NaiveBayes).

-   k-Nearest Neighbors (lazy.IBk).

-   Classification and Regression Trees (trees.REPTree).

-   Support Vector Machines (functions.SMO).

Experiment with each of these top algorithms.

Try them out on different classification datasets, such as those with
two classes and those with more.

**Lesson 10: Tour of Regression Algorithms** 
--------------------------------------------

Classification algorithms is Weka’s specialty, but many of these
algorithms can be used for regression.
Regression is the prediction of a real valued outcome (like a dollar
amount), different from classification that predicts a category (like
"dog" or "cat").

In this lesson you will discover 5 top regression algorithms that you
can use on your regression problems.

You can download a suite of standard regression machine learning
datasets from the [Weka dataset download
webpage](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/datasets.html). Download
the datasets-numeric.jar archive of regression problems, titled:

-   "A jar file containing 37 regression problems, obtained from various
    sources"

Use your favorite unzip program to unzip the .jar file and you will have
a new directory called numeric/ containing 37 regression problems that
you can work with.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/housing.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

4.  Click the "Choose" button.

5 Top algorithms that you can use for regression include:

-   Linear Regression (functions.LinearRegression).

-   Support Vector Regression (functions.SMOReg).

-   k-Nearest Neighbors (lazy.IBk).

-   Classification and Regression Trees (trees.REPTree).

-   Artificial Neural Network (functions.MultilayerPerceptron).

Experiment with each of these top algorithms.

Try them out on different regression datasets.

**Lesson 11: Tour of Ensemble Algorithms** 
------------------------------------------

Weka is very easy to use and this may be its biggest advantage over
other platforms.

In addition to this, Weka provides a large suite of ensemble machine
learning algorithms and this may be Weka’s second big advantage over
other platforms.

It is worth spending your time to get good at using Weka’s ensemble
algorithms. In this lesson you will discover 5 top ensemble machine
learning algorithms that you can use.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

4.  Click the "Choose" button.

5 Top ensemble algorithms that you can use include:

-   Bagging (meta.Bagging).

-   Random Forest (trees.RandomForest).

-   AdaBoost (meta.AdaBoost).

-   Voting (meta.Voting).

-   Stacking (meta.Stacking).

Experiment with each of these top algorithms.

Most of these ensemble methods let you choose the sub-models. Experiment
using different combinations of sub-models. Combinations of techniques
that work in very different ways and produce different predictions often
result in better performance.

Try them out on different classification and regression datasets.

**Lesson 12: Compare the Performance of Algorithms** 
----------------------------------------------------

Weka provides a different tool specifically designed for comparing
algorithms called the Weka Experiment Environment.
The Weka Experiment Environment allows you to design and execute
controlled experiments with machine learning algorithms and then analyze
the results.

In this lesson you will design your first experiment in Weka and
discover how to use the Weka Experiment Environment to compare the
performance of machine learning algorithms.

1.  Open the "Weka Chooser GUI".

2.  Click the "Experimenter" button to open the "Weka Experiment
    Environment".

3.  Click the "New" button.

4.  Click the "Add new…" button in the "Datasets" pane and select
    "data/diabetes.arff".

5.  Click the "Add new…" button in the "Algorithms" pane and add "ZeroR"
    and "IBk".

6.  Click the "Run" tab and click the "Start" button.

7.  Click the "Analyse" tab and click the "Experiment" button and then
    the "Perform test" button.

You just designed, executed and analysed the results of your first
controlled experiment in Weka.
You compared the ZeroR algorithm to the IBk algorithm with default
configuration on the diabetes dataset.

The results show that IBK has a higher classification accuracy than
ZeroR and that this difference is statistically significant (the little
"v" character next to the result).
Expand the experiment and add more algorithms and rerun the experiment.

Change the "Test base" on the "Analyse" tab to change which set of
results is taken as the reference for comparison to the other results.

**Lesson 13: Tune Algorithm Parameters** 
----------------------------------------

To get the most out of a machine learning algorithm you must tune the
parameters of the method to your problem.
You cannot know how to best do this before hand, therefore you must try
out lots of different parameters.
The Weka Experiment Environment allows you to design controlled
experiments to compare the results of different algorithm parameters and
whether the differences are statistically significant.

In this lesson you are going to design an experiment to compare the
parameters of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

1.  Open the "Weka Chooser GUI".

2.  Click the "Experimenter" button to open the "Weka Experiment
    Environment"

3.  Click the "New" button.

4.  Click the "Add new…" button in the "Datasets" pane and select
    "data/diabetes.arff".

5.  Click the "Add new…" button in the "Algorithms" pane and add 3 copes
    of the "IBk" algorithm.

6.  Click each IBk algorithm in the list and click the "Edit selected…"
    button and change "KNN" to 1, 3, 5 for each of the 3 different
    algorithms.

7.  Click the "Run" tab and click the "Start" button.

8.  Click the "Analyse" tab and click the "Experiment" button and then
    the "Perform test" button.

You just designed, executed and analyzed the results of a controlled
experiment to compare algorithm parameters.
We can see that the results for large K values is better than the
default of 1 and the difference is significant.
Explore changing other configuration properties of KNN and build
confidence in developing experiments to tune machine learning
algorithms.

**Lesson 14: Save Your Model** 
------------------------------

Once you have found a top performing model on your problem you need to
finalize it for later use.
In this final lesson you will discover how to train a final model and
save it to a file for later use.

1.  Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer.

2.  Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.

3.  Click the "Classify" tab.

4.  Change the "Test options" to "Use training set" and click the
    "Start" button.

5.  Right click on the results in the "Result list" and click "Save
    model" and enter a filename like "diabetes-final".

You have just trained a final model on the entire training dataset and
saved the resulting model to a file.
You can load this model back into Weka and use it to make predictions on
new data.

1.  Right-click on the "Result list" click "Load model" and select your
    model file ("diabetes-final.model").

2.  Change the "Test options" to "Supplied test set" and choose
    data/diabetes.arff (this could be a new file for which you do not
    have predictions)

3.  Click "More options" in the "Test options" and change "Output
    predictions" to "Plain Text"

4.  Right click on the loaded model and choose "Re-evaluate model on
    current test set".

The new predictions will now be listed in the "Classifier output" pane.

Experiment saving different models and making predictions for entirely
new datasets.
